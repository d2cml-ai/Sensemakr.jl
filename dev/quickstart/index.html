In this application, we are interested in answering the following question: did being directly exposed to harm make individuals more “angry,” and thus more likely to ask for revenge, or did it make them more &quot;weary,&quot; and thus more likely to ask for peace?</p><p><code>Sensemakr</code> comes with the Darfur dataset, which can be loaded with the command <code>data.load_darfur()</code>.

What if is wrong? How strong would these unobserved variables have to be in order to change the original research conclusions? The goal of <code>Sensemakr</code> is precisely that, i.e, to make it easier to understand the impact that omitted variables would have on a regression result.</p><p>The main function of the package is the function <code>sensemakr</code>. The <code>sensemakr</code> function defines an object of type <code>sensemakr</code>, performing the most commonly required sensitivity analyses which can then be further explored with the <code>summary</code> and <code>plot</code> methods of the object. This function is mainly a convenience wrapper for other sensitivity functions defined in the package, which can also be called directly, as we detail later in the documentation.</p><p>In the code chunk below, we apply the function <code>sensemakr</code> to our OLS model from statsmodel.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">darfur_sense = sensemakr(fitted_model, &quot;directlyharmed&quot;, benchmark_covariates = &quot;female&quot;, kd = [1, 2, 3], ky = [1, 2, 3], q = 1.0, alpha = 0.05, reduce = true);</code></pre><p>The main arguments of the call are:</p><p><strong>model</strong>: the OLS model with the outcome regression. In our case, <code>darfur_model</code>.</p><p><strong>treatment</strong>: the name of the treatment variable. In our case, &quot;directlyharmed&quot;.</p><p><strong>benchmark_covariates</strong>: the names of covariates that will be used to bound the plausible strength of the unobserved confounders. Here, we put &quot;female&quot;, which is arguably one of the main determinants of exposure to violence, and also a strong determinant of attitudes towards peace.</p><p><strong>kd</strong> and <strong>ky</strong>: these arguments parameterize how many times stronger the confounder is related to the treatment (kd) and to the outcome (ky) in comparison to the observed benchmark covariates (in this case, female). In our example, setting <code>kd = [1, 2, 3]</code> and ky = <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> means we want to investigate the maximum strength of a confounder once, twice, or three times as strong as female (in explaining treatment and outcome variation). If only <code>kd</code> is given, <code>ky</code> will be set equal to <code>kd</code>.</p><p><strong>q</strong>: fraction of the effect estimate that would have to be explained away to be problematic. Setting q = 1, means that a reduction of 100% of the current effect estimate, that is, a true effect of zero, would be deemed problematic. The default is 1.</p><p><strong>alpha</strong>: significance level of interest for statistical inference. The default is 0.05.</p><p><strong>reduce</strong>: should we consider confounders acting towards increasing or reducing the absolute value of the estimate? The default is <code>reduce = true</code>, which means we are considering confounders that pull the estimate towards (or through) zero.</p><p>Using the default arguments, one can simplify the previous call to:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">darfur_sense = sensemakr(fitted_model, &quot;directlyharmed&quot;, benchmark_covariates = &quot;female&quot;, kd = [1, 2, 3]);</code></pre><p>Once we run <code>sensemakr</code>, we can now explore the sensitivity analysis results.</p><h2 id="Minimal-sensitivity-reporting"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Minimal-sensitivity-reporting">Minimal sensitivity reporting</a><a id="Minimal-sensitivity-reporting-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Minimal-sensitivity-reporting" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The print method of Sensemakr provides a quick review of the original (unadjusted) estimates along with three summary sensitivity statistics suited for routine reporting: the partial <span>$R^2$</span> of the treatment with the outcome, the robustness value (<span>$RV$</span>) required to reduce the estimate entirely to zero (i.e. <span>$q=1$</span>), and the RV beyond which the estimate would no longer be statistically distinguishable from zero at the 0.05 level</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">print(darfur_sense)</code></pre><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">Sensitivity Analysis to Unobserved Confounding

More precisely:</p><p>The robustness value for bringing the point estimate of directlyharmed exactly to zero (<span>$RV_{q=1}$</span>) is 13.9% . This means that unobserved confounders that explain 13.9% of the residual variance both of the treatment and of the outcome are sufficiently strong to explain away all the observed effect. On the other hand, unobserved confounders that do not explain at least 13.9% of the residual variance both of the treatment and of the outcome are not sufficiently strong to do so.</p><p>The robustness value for testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient of directlyharmed is zero (<span>$RV_{q=1, \alpha = 0.05}$</span>) falls to 7.6%.

On the other hand, unobserved confounders that do not explain at least 7.6% of the residual variance both of the treatment and of the outcome are not sufficiently strong to do so.</p><p>Finally, the partial <span>$R^2$</span> of directlyharmed with peacefactor means that, in an extreme scenario, in which we assume that unobserved confounders explain all of the left out variance of the outcome, these unobserved confounders would need to explain at least 2.2% of the residual variance of the treatment to fully explain away the observed effect.</p><p>The lower corner of the table, further provides bounds on the strength of an unobserved confounder as strong as the observed covariate <code>female</code>, resulting in <span>$R^2_{Y\sim Z\mid X, D} = 12.5\%$</span> and <span>$R^2_{D\sim Z\mid X} = .9\%$</span>.

Verbal interpretation of sensitivity statistics:

-- Partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome: an extreme confounder (orthogonal to the covariates) that explains 100% of the residual variance of the outcome, would need to explain at least 2.187 % of the residual variance of the treatment to fully account for the observed estimated effect.

-- Robustness Value, q = 1.0: unobserved confounders (orthogonal to the covariates) that of both the treatment and the outcome are strong enough to bring the point estimate to 0.0 (a bias of 100.0% of the original estimate). Conversely, unobserved confounders that do not explain more than 13.878% of the residual variance of both the treatment and the outcome are not strong enough to bring the point estimate to 0.0.

-- Robustness Value,q = 1.0, alpha = 0.05: unobserved confounders (orthogonal to the covariates) that explain more than 7.626% of the residual variance of both the treatment and the outcome are strong enough to bring the estimate to a range where it is no longer &#39;statistically different&#39; from 0.0 (a bias of 100.0% of the original estimate), at the significance level of alpha = 0.05. Conversely, unobserved confounders that do not explain more than7.626% of the residual varianceof both the treatment and the outcome are not strong enough to bring the estimate to a range where it is no longer &#39;statistically different&#39; from 0.0, at the significance level of alpha = 0.05.

Bounds on omitted variable bias:
--The table below shows the maximum strength of unobserved confounders with association with the treatment and the outcome bounded by a multiple of the observed explanatory power of the chosen benchmark covariate(s).
