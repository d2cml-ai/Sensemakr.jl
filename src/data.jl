Provide the example data of darfur based on a survey among Darfurian refugees in eastern Chad.

The data is on attitudes of Darfurian refugees in eastern Chad. The main “treatment” variable is directlyharmed, which indicates that the individual was physically injured during attacks on villages in Darfur, largely between 2003 and 2004. The main outcome of interest is peacefactor, a measure of pro-peace attitudes.

Key covariates include herder_dar (whether they were a herder in Darfur), farmer_dar (whether they were a farmer in Darfur), age, female (indicator for female), and past_voted (whether they report having voted in an earlier election, prior to the conflict).

A data frame with 1276 rows and 14 columns.
