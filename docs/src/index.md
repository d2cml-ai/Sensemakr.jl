# Sensemakr

Documentation for [Sensemakr](https://github.com/d2cml-ai/Sensemakr.jl), which implements a suite of sensitivity analysis tools that makes it easier to understand the impact of omitted variables in linear regression models, as discussed in [Cinelli and Hazlett (2020)](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12348).

The Julia version of the package closely mirrors the R version, which can be found [here](http://carloscinelli.com/sensemakr/).
